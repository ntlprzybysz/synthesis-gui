        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This website provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for speech synthesis tools developed by
                <a href="https://stefantaubert.com/">Stefan Taubert</a>. The aim of this project is to offer 
            an alternative way of accessing these tools to those who are unable or prefer not to use 
            the original command-line interface (CLI).
        </p>
        <p>The primary tool featured in this GUI is a CLI designed for training Tacotron 2 using .wav and .TextGrid pairs. 
            You can explore <a href="https://github.com/stefantaubert/tacotron"> the repository for Tacotron on GitHub</a>
            to learn more. The second tool is a CLI that for training WaveGlow using .wav files, see
            <a href="https://github.com/stefantaubert/waveglow">waveglow</a> on Github. You can listen to 
            an audio sample of a text: "The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, 
            when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak."

        </p>
        <p>
            The web interface for these tools has been developed by 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ntl-przybysz/">Natalia Przybysz</a>. It incorporates technologies 
            such as Django, Bootstrap, Gunicorn, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Celery, and Celery Beat. The project's source code 
            is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ntlprzybysz/synthesis-gui">GitHub Repository</a>.
