    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <p>This website provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for speech synthesis tools developed by
        <a href="https://stefantaubert.com/">Stefan Taubert</a>. The aim of this project is to offer 
        an alternative way of accessing these tools to those who are unable or prefer not to use 
        the original command-line interface (CLI).
    </p>
    <p>    
        The website was developed by Natalia Przybysz using Django, incorporating a combination of Python, HTML, 
        CSS, and JavaScript. The source code for this project <a href="https://github.com/ntlprzybysz/synthesis-gui">
        can be found on GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The primary tool featured in this GUI is a CLI designed for training Tacotron 2 using .wav and .TextGrid pairs. 
        You can explore <a href="https://github.com/stefantaubert/tacotron"> the repository for Tacotron on GitHub</a>
        to learn more. The second tool is a CLI that for training WaveGlow using .wav files, see
        <a href="https://github.com/stefantaubert/waveglow">waveglow</a> on Github. You can listen to 
        an audio sample of a text: "The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, 
        when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak."
